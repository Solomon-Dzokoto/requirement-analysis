📘 What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a fundamental phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent phases of the project, ensuring that the final product meets user demands and aligns with business goals.

🔍 What It Involves:
Requirement Analysis is not just about collecting user requests. It involves:

Eliciting requirements through interviews, surveys, observations, and brainstorming sessions.

Analyzing those requirements to detect conflicts, ambiguities, or redundancies.

Documenting the findings in the form of requirement specifications, use cases, and user stories.

Validating requirements by reviewing them with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and feasibility.

🚀 Why It's Important in the SDLC:
✅ Defines Project Scope: Clearly outlines what should and shouldn’t be included in the system, preventing scope creep.

🛠️ Guides Design & Development: Provides a blueprint for developers and designers to follow.

📉 Reduces Rework & Costs: Early clarification reduces the likelihood of costly changes later in development.

🤝 Enhances Stakeholder Communication: Acts as a common language between technical and non-technical team members.

🧪 Supports Testing: Establishes acceptance criteria and test cases to ensure the system meets its intended purpose.

Without effective requirement analysis, teams risk building a product that is technically sound but fails to satisfy the actual needs of its users.
