📄 Requirement Analysis
📘 What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical process in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the needs of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. It ensures that the software being built solves the right problems and delivers value to its users.

Why It Matters:
Prevents costly rework by clarifying requirements early.

Sets the foundation for design, development, and testing.

Aligns business goals with technical implementation.

❓ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Defines Clear Project Scope

Establishes boundaries for what the system will and won’t do.

Helps manage stakeholder expectations and reduces scope creep.

Improves Communication

Creates a shared understanding between technical teams and business stakeholders.

Acts as a reference point throughout the project.

Reduces Development Cost & Time

Identifies potential issues early, avoiding costly fixes later.

Streamlines development with well-defined requirements and priorities.

🔑 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Gathering

Collect information from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, observations, etc.

Requirement Elicitation

Clarify, explore, and refine requirements using brainstorming, prototyping, and analysis.

Requirement Documentation

Record requirements in formats such as SRS, user stories, or use case documents.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling

Examine feasibility, conflicts, and dependencies.

Create models like data flow diagrams, use case diagrams, etc.

Requirement Validation

Confirm that documented requirements reflect stakeholders’ needs.

Conduct reviews and walkthroughs with clients and teams.

🧩 Types of Requirements
🛠 Functional Requirements
These describe what the system should do. They define system behaviors, features, and interactions.

Examples for Booking System:

User registration and login.

Booking a property.

Viewing booking history.

Cancelling a booking.

🔒 Non-functional Requirements
These describe how the system should perform. They cover system qualities like performance, usability, and security.

Examples:

The system must load booking pages within 2 seconds.

All sensitive user data must be encrypted.

The system must support up to 10,000 concurrent users.

🎯 Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system, helping teams understand system functionality at a high level.

Benefits:
Provides a clear overview of system functionality.

Helps identify system boundaries and actors.

Facilitates communication with non-technical stakeholders.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria are conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders. They ensure that developers and stakeholders have a shared understanding of what is "done."

Importance:
Sets clear expectations.

Guides development and testing.

Helps prevent misunderstandings and scope creep.

Example: Checkout Feature – Booking System
Feature: Finalize a booking and process payment.

Acceptance Criteria:

The user must be able to review booking details before payment.

The system must validate card details and return appropriate errors.

The system must confirm successful payment with a summary screen.

Confirmation email must be sent automatically to the user.
